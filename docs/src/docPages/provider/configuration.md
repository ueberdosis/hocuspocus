# Configuration

## toc

## Introduction
Pass a single object with all your custom settings to the provider and you’re good to go.

## Configure the provider
There is not much required to set up the provider, here is how a minimal setup should look like:

```js
const ydoc = new Y.Doc()

const provider = new HocuspocusProvider({
  url: 'ws://127.0.0.1:1234',
  name: 'example-document',
  document: ydoc,
  // …
})
```
