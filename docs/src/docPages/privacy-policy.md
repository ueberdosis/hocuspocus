We don’t provide email support for hocuspocus, but if you have some legal issues, privacy or security concerns, send us an email to [humans@hocuspocus.dev](mailto:humans@hocuspocus.dev). For everything else, [please use GitHub issues](https://github.com/ueberdosis/hocuspocus-issues/issues). We’ll make sure to get back to you quickly.

## List of external services
With that in mind, we still need a few external services to publish hocuspocus. Let’s go through them one by one.

### Hosting (Netlify)
We use Netlify to host the documentation. It features continuous deployment from Git across a global application delivery network and full integration with Let’s Encrypt. If you want to know more, [read Netlify’s privacy policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/).

### Tracking (Plausible)
We use [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) to gain insight about our visitors in general. It doesn’t track individual users per se and does not store any personal identifiable information. [Go to their website](https://plausible.io/) to find out what Plausible collects (and more importantly what they don’t).

Or have a look at the [~~public~~ analytics dashboard](https://plausible.io/hocuspocus.dev) (soon) they provide. It’s not a stripped down version, it’s the exact same dashboard we use to check the traffic.

<!-- ### Search (Algolia)
We use [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) to offer search functionality for the documentation. They crawl the same pages as you see once every day. If you click on the search field on top of this page, their search interface pops up.

If you want to know more about what data they collect and process, [read their privacy policy](https://www.algolia.com/policies/privacy/). -->

### Mailing (Mailcoach)
For the mailing list we use a self-hosted [Mailcoach](https://mailcoach.app/) instance, which is hosted on of our bare metal servers at [Servivum](https://www.servivum.com/).

### Emails (Mailgun)
The actual emails we send to mailing list subscribers are sent through [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) (EU). We’d love to send them through our own infrastructure, but email is pretty hard.

## Suggesting alternatives
If you know a good self-hosted version of any of the mentioned services, create an issue on GitHub or send us an email to [humans@hocuspocus.dev](mailto:humans@hocuspocus.dev).
