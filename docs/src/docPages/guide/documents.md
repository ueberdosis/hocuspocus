## Documents & room-names

Most Yjs connection providers (including the `y-websocket` provider) use a concept called
room-names. The client will pass a room-name parameter to Hocuspocus which will then be used to
identify the document which is currently being edited. We will call room-name throughout this
documentation document name.

In a real-world app you would probably use the name of your entity and a unique ID. Here is how that
could look like for a CMS:

```js
const documentName = 'page.140'
```

Now you can easily split this to get all desired information separately:

```js
const [entityType, entityID] = documentName.split('.')

console.log(entityType) // prints "page"
console.log(entityID) // prints "140
```

This is a recommendation, of course you can name your documents however you want!

## Using a primary storage

One thing up front:

The following examples are **not intended** to be your primary storage as serializing to and
deserializing from JSON will not store collaboration history steps but only the resulting document.
These examples are only meant to store the resulting document for the views of your application or
to import it if it doesn't exist in your primary storage.

No worries, we have you covered! We built an extension that's meant to be used as primary storage:
the [RocksDB extension](/api/extensions/rocksdb). It's just a couple of lines to integrate.

Make sure to always include this extension in your production setups!

## Handling Document changes

With the `onChange` hook you can listen to changes of the document and handle them. It should return
a Promise. It's payload contains the resulting document as well as the actual update in the Y-Doc
binary format. For more information on the hook and it's payload checkout it'
s [API section](/api/on-change).

In a real-world application you would probably save the current document to a database, send it via
webhook to an API or something else. If you want to send a webhook to an external API we already
have you covered: [Check out our webhook extension](/api/extensions/webhook).

It's **highly recommended** to debounce extensive operations (like API calls) as this hook can be
fired up to multiple times a second:

You need to serialize the Y-Doc that Hocuspocus gives you to something you can actually display in
your views. Check out the [transformers section](/guide/transformers) of the guide for more
information.

```typescript
import {debounce} from 'debounce'
import {Server} from '@hocuspocus/server'
import {TiptapTransformer} from '@hocuspocus/transformer'
import {writeFile} from 'fs'

let debounced

const Hocuspocus = Server.configure({
  async onChange(data) {
    const save = () => {
      // Convert the y-doc to something you can actually use in your views.
      // In this example we use the TiptapTransformer to get JSON from the given
      // ydoc.
      const prosemirrorJSON = TiptapTransformer.fromYdoc(data.document)

      // Save your document. In a real-world app this could be a database query
      // a webhook or something else
      writeFile(
        `/path/to/your/documents/${data.documentName}.json`,
        prosemirrorJSON
      )

      // Maybe you want to store the user who changed the document?
      // Guess what, you have access to your custom context from the
      // onAuthenticate hook here. See authorization & authentication for more
      // details
      console.log(`Document ${data.documentName} changed by ${data.context.user.name}`)
    }

    debounced?.clear()
    debounced = debounce(() => save, 4000)
    debounced()
  },
})

hocuspocus.listen()
```

## Importing documents

If you want to alter the Y-Doc when Hocuspocus creates it, you can use the `onLoadDocument` hook
and apply updates directly to the given document. This way you can load your document from a
database, an external API or even the file system if they are **not present** in
your [primary storage](#using-a-primary-storage). For more information on the hook and it's payload
checkout it's [API section](/api/on-create-document).

`onLoadDocument` expects a Y-Doc to be returned. Check out
the [transformers section](/guide/transformers) of the guide for more information.

```typescript
import {readFileSync} from 'fs'
import {Server} from '@hocuspocus/server'
import {Doc} from 'yjs'
import {TiptapTransformer} from '@hocuspocus/transformer'
import Document from '@tiptap/extension-document'
import Paragraph from '@tiptap/extension-paragraph'
import Text from '@tiptap/extension-text'

const Hocuspocus = Server.configure({
  async onLoadDocument(data): Doc {
    // The tiptap collaboration extension uses shared types of a single y-doc
    // to store different fields in the same document.
    // The default field in tiptap is simply called "default"
    const fieldName = 'default'

    // Check if the given field already exists in the given y-doc.
    // Important: Only import a document if it doesn't exist in the primary data storage!
    if (!data.document.isEmpty(fieldName)) {
      return
    }

    // Get the document from somwhere. In a real world application this would
    // probably be a database query or an API call
    const prosemirrorJSON = JSON.parse(
      readFileSync(`/path/to/your/documents/${data.documentName}.json`) || "{}"
    )

    // Convert the editor format to a y-doc. The TiptapTransformer requires you to pass the list
    // of extensions you use in the frontend to create a valid document
    return TiptapTransformer.toYdoc(prosemirrorJSON, fieldName, [Document, Paragraph, Text])
  },
})

hocuspocus.listen()
```

## Importing a document with multiple fields

When using multiple fields you can simply merge different documents into the given document:

```typescript
import {readFileSync} from 'fs'
import {Server} from '@hocuspocus/server'
import {TiptapTransformer} from '@hocuspocus/transformer'
import Document from '@tiptap/extension-document'
import Paragraph from '@tiptap/extension-paragraph'
import Text from '@tiptap/extension-text'

const generateSampleProsemirrorJson = (text: string) => {
  return {
    type: 'doc',
    content: [
      {
        type: 'paragraph',
        content: [
          {
            type: 'text',
            text,
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  }
}

const Hocuspocus = Server.configure({
  async onLoadDocument(data) {

    // only import things if they are not already set in the primary storage
    if (data.document.isEmpty('default')) {
      // Get a Y-Doc for the 'default' field …
      const defaultField = TiptapTransformer.toYdoc(
        generateSampleProsemirrorJson('What is love?'),
        'default'
          [Document, Paragraph, Text],
      )

      // … and merge it into the given document
      data.document.merge(defaultField)
    }

    if (data.document.isEmpty('secondary')) {
      // Get a Y-Doc for the 'secondary' field …
      const secondaryField = TiptapTransformer.toYdoc(
        generateSampleProsemirrorJson('Baby don\'t hurt me…'),
        'secondary'
          [Document, Paragraph, Text],
      )

      // … and merge it into the given document
      data.document.merge(secondaryField)
    }
  },
})

hocuspocus.listen()
```

## Read only mode

If you want to restrict the current user only to read the document and it's updates but not apply
updates him- or herself, you can use the `connection` property in the `onAuthenticate` hooks payload:

```typescript
import { Server } from '@hocuspocus/server'

const usersWithWriteAccess = [
  'jane', 'john', 'christina',
]

const Hocuspocus = Server.configure({
  async onAuthenticate(data): Doc {

    // Example code to check if the current user has write access by a
    // request parameter. In a real world application you would probably
    // get the user by a token from your database
    if(!usersWithWriteAccess.includes(data.requestParameters.get('user'))) {
      // Set the connection to readonly
      data.connection.readOnly = true
    }

  },
})

hocuspocus.listen()
```
