# Hooks

## Introduction
Hooks are a core concept to control the behaviour and data flow of the server. All hooks are async. That means you can even do things like executing API requests, running DB queries, trigger webhooks or whatever you need to do to integrate it into your application.

If a user isn’t allowed to connect: Just send `reject()` in the `onConnect()` hook. Nice, isn’t it?

```js
import { Server } from '@hocuspocus/server'

const server = Server.configure({
  async onAuthenticate({ documentName, token }) {

    // Could be an API call, DB query or whatever …
    // The endpoint should return 200 OK in case the user is authenticated, and an http error
    // in case the user is not.
    return axios.get('/user', {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
      }
    })
  },
})

server.listen()
```
