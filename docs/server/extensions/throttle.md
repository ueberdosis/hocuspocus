# Extension Throttle

This extension throttles connection attempts and bans ip-addresses if it crosses the configured threshold.

Make sure to register it **before** any other extensions!

## Installation

Install the Throttle package with:

```bash
npm install @hocuspocus/extension-throttle
```

## Configuration

```js
import { Server } from "@hocuspocus/server";
import { Throttle } from "@hocuspocus/extension-throttle";

const server = new Server({
  extensions: [
    new Throttle({
      // [optional] allows up to 15 connection attempts per ip address per minute.
      // set to null or false to disable throttling, defaults to 15
      throttle: 15,

      // [optional] bans ip addresses for 5 minutes after reaching the threshold
      // defaults to 5
      banTime: 5,
    }),
  ],
});

server.listen();
```
