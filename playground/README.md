# Hocuspocus Playground

```
Hi!

Welcome to the playground. This is mainly meant for internal usage during Hocuspocus development,
but feel free to fiddle around here and find a few examples of how things can work.

Please note that there are different packages used in frontend / backend folders, so you should
run `npm install` in both if you get any errors.

You can run `npm run playground` in the repository root, which will spin up a development server on
http://127.0.0.1:3000.

If you have any questions, feel free to join our discord or ask on Github (links can be found in the
repo README.md one folder up).
```
